											<br>
											To set up the site, I used a pre-built template from Envato and JetBrains

											Challenge: I changed my mind about the portfolio template I wanted to use, and I simply
											deleted the directory and redeployed by pushing to GitHub with the new

											<h4>Question 5:</h4>
											<p>Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major

										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
											<h4>Answer:</h4>
											<p>One major challenge for less-technical customers hosting websites is the
												complexity of DNS terminology, jargon, and underlying concepts. Terms
												like A records, CNAME records, and MX Records can be confusing for those
												without a technical background. Customers may struggle to understand
												what these records do and how they affect their website's performance
												and accessibility. To add to the confusion, documentation is often
												lacking, too brief, or incorrect. This lack of clarity often leads to
												misconfigurations, such as pointing a domain to the wrong IP address or
												failing to set up necessary records for email services, which can result
												in frustrating website downtimes or communication issues.
												<br><br>Another significant challenge is the propagation delay that
												occurs after making DNS changes. Customers often expect immediate results
												when they update their DNS settings. This can lead to frustration when
												things appear not to be working as expected. Without a clear
												understanding of this process, customers may inadvertently make multiple
												unnecessary changes, complicating the issue further and delaying the
												troubleshooting process. Effective communication, education, and
												documentation about DNS concepts and propagation timelines are essential
												to help customers navigate these issues.

											<h4>Question 6:</h4>
											<p>A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”.
												You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build
												failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2.
												You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository
												is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot
												this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best
												customer-facing first response.</p><br><br>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
											<h4>Answer:</h4>
											<p>Because of the limited context in this particular case, it’s important to
												focus on identifying the problem fully before establishing a hypothesis
												about the probable cause. So, step one would be to contact the customer
												for more information, including the build command (if used), environment
												variables (if any), whether there have been any recent updates to the
												codebase or dependencies, and whether the application runs locally.<br><br>
												Customer response:<br><br>
												Hi Customer,<br><br>
												Thank you for reaching out to us about the build issue with your site.
												I see from the build logs that the error is a "non-zero exit code: 2,"
												which typically indicates that something went wrong during the build
												process.
												<br><br>
												To help us troubleshoot this further, could you provide some additional
												details? Specifically:
												<ul>
													<li>Recent Changes: Have you made any changes to your code or build configuration recently?</li>
													<li>Build Command: What build command are you using? This can often give us insight into the issue.</li>
													<li>Environment Variables: Are all the needed environment variables in place?</li>
													<li>Dependencies: Are there any specific dependencies or packages
														that your project relies on that might not be included in your configuration?</li>
												</ul>
												<br><br>
												In the meantime, I recommend testing the build locally if you haven't already, as it may help pinpoint the issue.
												Once I have more information, I'll be better equipped to assist you in resolving this problem. Thank you for your patience!
												<br><br>
												Warm regards,<br><br>

											<p>We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures

												steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What
												might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their
												assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very
												concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the

										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
											<h4>Answer:</h4>
											<p>My first step upon receiving a report of a severe security issue on
												www.netlify.com would be to initiate an immediate internal investigation
												to verify the claim. I would start by reviewing any security logs
												available to the team for any unusual activity, such as unauthorized
												access attempts, unusual IP addresses, or unexpected changes to files or
												configurations. Next, I would access any observability or monitoring tool
												available to see if there are any pertaining alerts. If the site is
												under a content management system (CMS) or uses third-party plugins,
												I would assess their security statuses, if possible, and check for any
												known vulnerabilities or recent exploits that could be relevant.
												<br><br>After doing my initial research, I would respond to the reporter
												acknowledging their concerns and thanking them for bringing the issue to
												our attention. I would assure them that we take security very seriously
												and that I am actively investigating the matter to determine the next
												steps. I would convey our commitment to maintaining a secure environment.
												I would outline how the investigation would proceed, including the review
												of logs and check of our security/monitoring systems.
												<br><br>If I believe the report has merit and the issue could be significant,
												I would first confer with my teammates about any other reports or known
												issues, and then escalate it to the security team immediately, providing
												them with all relevant details and findings from my initial investigation.
												This would include any evidence gathered, the potential scope and impact,
												and a recommendation for further immediate investigation.
